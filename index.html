      <p class="p1"> First, we will have to learn about the cloud before we learn about cloud computing. In the most simple terms the cloud is a place to store digital files or documents in a huge data server far off of your computer's hard drive. In the cloud you can save your videos, photos, music, documents, etc. You can access that media on any device connected to the World Wide Web. Many companies own clouds. There are three types of cloud deployments that companies use: public, private, and hybrid. A public cloud is owned and operated by a third party which delivers their storage through the internet. Anyone can access these clouds for their use. Private clouds refer to the cloud computing of businesses for themselves. For example, if a business has their own cloud for their employees, then it is a private cloud. Hybrid clouds are the combination of private and public clouds. Hybrid clouds allow data to be sent to either cloud (public or private) either way.

        Some benefits of storing your data on a cloud include:
<ul>
  <li>You will never lose any documents if your computer breaks, malfunctions, or gets a virus because your files will be saved online.
  </li>
    
<li>Clouds are very accessible. You can access them from almost any device and all you need then is internet connection. 
  </li>
  <li>
    You also do not need to worry about using up storage on your computer because (depending on your company and plan) you can store countless files and free up space on your device.
  </li>
        </ul>

<h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
<p>
Cloud computing is the delivery service of the cloud. It delivers all your media to the storage servers some place else. It is also the storing of data and applications and accessing them via the internet. There are two ends of the cloud. The front end and the back end. They are connected by the internet. The front end is your side. It represents your computer and how you access the cloud. 
          <br/>
          Pros:
          <ul>
            <li>Cloud computing is fast.</li>
            <li>Cloud computing is not expensive.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>
        Types of Cloud Services
        </h2>
        <h3>
        SaaS (Software as a Service)
        </h3>
        <p>
        Saas or Software as a Service is when the cloud computing is done via a software application on a website. Some common examples of websites that use SaaS for cloud computing are: Salesforce, Google Apps, Dropbox and Box. All these companies use a software to provide cloud service and are all solutions to storing documents and files on your computer. SaaS softwares are usually sold in a subscription model. Applications that use Saas have to pay less money because it does not take as many technical staff to manage.
        </p>
        <h3>
        PaaS (Platform as a Service)
        </h3>
        <p>
        Paas or Platform as a Service is the middle ground between SaaS and IaaS. Its provides a platform where software can be developed and deployed. Paas allows users to focus on the business side of scalability. Like a lot of cloud services, Paas is built on virtualization technology. Some companies that use Paas cloud computing are Google App Engine, Heroku, and Red Hatâ€™s OpenShift.
        </p>
        <h3>
        IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
        </h3>
        <p>
        IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service is the building block for cloud computing. It is done via a dashboard or API. Users of Iaas have direct access to files and have the power to create a virtual data center. The virtual data center is very much like a traditional data center except users do not have to do all the management required for a traditional data center. Iaas users have more control over users of PaaS and SaaS. Some companies that use IaaS cloud computing are Navisite, exoscale, and Softlayer.
